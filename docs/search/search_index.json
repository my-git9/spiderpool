Priority Spiderpool supports the following ways to specify ippool for Pod: Pod annotations ( high priority ): Specifies which ippool the current Pod should use to allocate IP, which overrides any other selection rules. ipam.spidernet.io/ippool : For single interface case. Ensure that the interface field specified in Pod annotations is consistent with that in the CNI request. yaml ipam.spidernet.io/ippool: |- { \"interface\": \"eth0\", \"ipv4pools\": [\"v4-ippool1\"], \"ipv6pools\": [\"v6-ippool1\", \"v6-ippool2\"] } ipam.spidernet.io/ippools : For multiple interfaces case. Note that it does not means that CNI will return the IP allocation results of multiple interfaces in one request (this will break the CNI Specification ). Spiderpool will allocate multiple IP in one request, but return them in several times. It is mainly used with Spiderflat CNI and multus CNI . You can get more details of \"multus + Spiderpool\" here . yaml ipam.spidernet.io/ippools: |- [{ \"interface\": \"eth0\", \"ipv4pools\": [\"v4-ippool1\"], \"ipv6pools\": [\"v6-ippool1\"], \"defaultRoute\": true },{ \"interface\": \"eth1\", \"ipv4pools\": [\"v4-ippool2\"], \"ipv6pools\": [\"v6-ippool2\"], \"defaultRoute\": false }] BTW, ipam.spidernet.io/ippools has precedence over ipam.spidernet.io/ippool . Namespace annotations ( medium priority ): Specifies default ippools for current Namespace. Pods that do not have Pod IPAM annotations under this Namespace will all be allocated IP by these ippools. ipam.spidernet.io/defaultv4ippool : Default IPv4 ippools at Namespace level. yaml ipam.spidernet.io/defaultv4ippool: '[\"v4-ippool1\",\"v4-ippool2\"]' ipam.spidernet.io/defaultv6ippool : Default IPv6 ippools at Namespace level. yaml ipam.spidernet.io/defaultv6ippool: '[\"v6-ippool1\",\"v6-ippool2\"]' Configmap ( low priority )\uff1aDefault ippools at cluster level. Pods that do not append any special ippool selection rules will try to allocate IP from these ippools. They are valid throughout the cluster. yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: spiderpool-conf namespace: kube-system data: clusterDefaultIPv4IPPool: [default-v4-ippool] clusterDefaultIPv6IPPool: [default-v6-ippool] ... More details of Spiderpool annotation and configuration . Backup Each ippool selection rule supports 'backup'. We can specify multiple ippools in the array to achieve this effect. Spiderpool will successively try to allocate IP in the order of the elements in the ippool array until the first allocation succeeds or all fail. The following is an example of Pod annotation ipam.spidernet.io/ippool , the same is true for other ippool selection rules. We can create such a Pod: apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: sample-backup annotations: ipam.spidernet.io/ippool: |- { \"interface\": \"eth0\", \"ipv4pools\": [\"default-v4-ippool\", \"backup-v4-ippool\"] } spec: containers: - name: sample-backup image: alpine imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity & wait\"] As we can see from the above, Pod sample-backup will attempt to allocate IP from ippools defined in field ipv4pools . Unfortunately, ippool default-v4-ippool has run out of IP. $ kubectl get spl NAME VERSION SUBNET ALLOCATED-IP-COUNT TOTAL-IP-COUNT DISABLE default-v4-ippool IPv4 172.18.0.0/16 5 5 false backup-v4-ippool IPv4 172.18.0.0/16 1 5 false We will see Pod sample-backup successfully allocated IP from ippool backup-v4-ippool . $ kubectl get swe sample-backup -n default NAME INTERFACE IPV4POOL IPV4 IPV6POOL IPV6 NODE CREATETION TIME sample-backup eth0 backup-v4-ippool 172.18.40.40/16 spider-worker 1m33s Selectors Ippool can also use nodeSelector , namesapceSelector and podSelector to filter its users. It should be regarded as a filtering mechanism rather than a ippool selection rule (refer to chapter Priority for ippool selection rules). All selectors follow the syntax of Kubernetes label selector , just like: selector: matchLabels: component: redis matchExpressions: - {key: tier, operator: In, values: [cache]} - {key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]} We have such an ippool: apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v1 kind: IPPool metadata: name: default-v4-ippool spec: disable: false ipVersion: IPv4 subnet: 172.18.0.0/16 ips: - 172.18.40.41-172.18.40.50 vlan: 0 namesapceSelector: matchLabels: foo: bar It means that only Pod under the Namespace with foo: bar label can use this ippool. At the same time, default-v4-ippool is also the default IPv4 ippool of the cluster. apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: spiderpool-conf namespace: kube-system data: enableIPv4: true enableIPv6: false clusterDefaultIPv4IPPool: [default-v4-ippool] clusterDefaultIPv6IPPool: [] ... Try to create a Deployment in default Namespace. $ kubectl create deployment my-deploy --image=nginx However, this Deployment will eventually fail to function properly because it is not allocated any IP, and not in a Namespace that matches ippool's namespaceSelector . So don't give too harsh selectors to cluster default ippools , which will not make life better :) Example After understanding what selectors' \"filtering mechanism\" is, let's take a look at how selectors work with ippool selection rules. There are two ippools: apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v1 kind: IPPool metadata: name: master-v4-ippool spec: ipVersion: IPv4 subnet: 172.18.0.0/16 ips: - 172.18.50.41-172.18.50.50 nodeSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master, operator: Exists} Obviously, ippool master-v4-ippool only works with the control plane nodes of Kubernetes. The Pod which scheduled to the master nodes can be correctly allocated IP from this ippool. apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v1 kind: IPPool metadata: name: worker-v4-ippool spec: ipVersion: IPv4 subnet: 172.18.0.0/16 ips: - 172.18.50.51-172.18.50.60 nodeSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master, operator: DoesNotExist} ippool worker-v4-ippool is the opposite. Then, we run the following Deployment example , which has 5 replicas. We expect that the Pods controlled by example can be evenly scheduled to master nodes and worker nodes. Of course, maybe you should remove some related Taints. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: example spec: replicas: 5 selector: matchLabels: app: example template: metadata: annotations: ipam.spidernet.io/ippool: |- { \"interface\": \"eth0\", \"ipv4pools\": [\"master-v4-ippool\", \"worker-v4-ippool\"] } labels: app: example spec: containers: - image: alpine imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: example command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity & wait\"] Finally, we will find that Pods at different nodes use different ippools. $ kubectl get swe -n default NAME INTERFACE IPV4POOL IPV4 IPV6POOL IPV6 NODE CREATETION TIME example-554cc84db6-kr8j5 eth0 master-v4-ippool 172.18.50.47/16 control-plane 3s example-554cc84db6-lkdbz eth0 worker-v4-ippool 172.18.50.51/16 worker 4s example-554cc84db6-qbmwv eth0 worker-v4-ippool 172.18.50.58/16 worker 3s example-554cc84db6-r6qpt eth0 worker-v4-ippool 172.18.50.55/16 worker 4s example-554cc84db6-rjstk eth0 master-v4-ippool 172.18.50.43/16 control-plane 4s","title":"Select ippool"},{"location":"usage/select-ippool/#select-ippool","text":"Spiderpool supports multiple ways to select ippool.
